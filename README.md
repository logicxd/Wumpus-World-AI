## Scoring

The performance measure of an agent is an integer score calculated based on the following:
* Start at 0 points
* -1 point for each action taken
* -10 for using the arrow (additional to the -1 point)
* -1000 points for falling into a pit or being eaten by the wumpus +1000 for climbing out of the cave with the gold

The game ends either when the agent dies, when the agent climbs out of the cave, or when the agentâ€™s score goes below -1000.

Score of **283.87** was averaged over 10,000 randomly generated worlds that are 4x4 to 7x7, with each square having a 20% chance of pit appearing.
